# Pulse Robot - One-Page Pitch

## The Problem 🚨

**Event ticketing is broken:**
- 💸 **High Fees**: Ticketmaster charges 10-15% + service fees
- 🎭 **Ticket Fraud**: $1B+ lost annually to fake tickets
- 🚫 **No Creator Value**: Artists earn nothing from resales
- 📉 **Platform Lock-in**: Organizers don't own their infrastructure
- 👥 **No Community**: One-time transactions, no ongoing relationships

---
