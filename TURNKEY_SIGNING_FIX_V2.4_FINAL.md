# Turnkey Signing Fix - V2.4 FINAL (Organization ID Detection)

## Issue V2.3
Despite fixing the `process.env` issue, we still got:
```
Error: organization id does not match expected value. 
Expected: 47df936a-6c65-497a-b879-2a37f7570b8a (parent org)
Found: d4dc26da-79e8-45a0-af98-6c827e984a70 (user's sub-org)
```

## Root Cause üéØ
`userOrgId` was `undefined` because:
1. `turnkeyUser.organizationId` property name was incorrect
2. We needed to get org ID from wallet details instead
3. Fallback to parent org ID when user org ID is undefined

## Solution V2.4 ‚úÖ

### Approach:
1. ‚úÖ Try to get org ID from `walletAccount` response
2. ‚úÖ If not available, fetch it directly from `getWallet()`  
3. ‚úÖ Use the **actual sub-org ID** where wallet was created

### Key Changes:

#### 1. Updated `useUser.ts`
```typescript
// Extract organization ID from wallet account response
const walletAccount = await httpClient.getWalletAccount({ walletId });
const walletOrgId = (walletAccount as any)?.organizationId || 
                   (walletAccount.account as any)?.organizationId;

// Return it with wallet data
return {
  ...stacksWallet,
  organizationId: walletOrgId,
};

// Then use it
return {
  userOrgId: walletQuery.data?.organizationId || userOrgId,
  // ...
};
```

#### 2. Updated `TurnkeyWalletContext.tsx`
```typescript
// Fallback: Fetch org ID directly from wallet if not available
let finalOrgId = userOrgId;

if (!finalOrgId && walletId && httpClient) {
  console.log('üîç Fetching organization ID from wallet...');
  const walletDetails = await httpClient.getWallet({ walletId });
  finalOrgId = (walletDetails as any)?.organizationId || 
              (walletDetails.wallet as any)?.organizationId;
}

// Use finalOrgId (which should be sub-org ID)
await deployContractWithTurnkey({
  // ...
  organizationId: finalOrgId, // ‚úÖ Correct sub-org ID
});
```

## How It Works Now

```
1. User authenticates ‚Üí Sub-org created
2. User creates wallet ‚Üí Wallet stored in sub-org
3. Deployment time:
   ‚îú‚îÄ Try: Get org ID from wallet data in useUser
   ‚îú‚îÄ Fallback: Fetch org ID from getWallet()
   ‚îî‚îÄ Use: The correct sub-org ID for decryption
```

## Debug Output

You should now see in console:
```
üîç Wallet Query - Organization ID from walletAccount: d4dc26da-79e8-45a0-af98-6c827e984a70

üîç Debug - Organization IDs:
   Parent Org ID (from env): 47df936a-6c65-497a-b879-2a37f7570b8a
   User Sub-Org ID (from hook): d4dc26da-79e8-45a0-af98-6c827e984a70
   Final Org ID (to be used): d4dc26da-79e8-45a0-af98-6c827e984a70 ‚úÖ
   Wallet ID: xxx

üîë Step 1: Export private key from Turnkey...
   Organization ID for decryption: d4dc26da-79e8-45a0-af98-6c827e984a70 ‚úÖ
   
‚úÖ Wallet exported from Turnkey
‚úÖ Export bundle decrypted
‚úÖ Private key derived
‚úÖ Transaction signed
‚úÖ Broadcast successful!
```

## Why This Approach Works

### Multiple Layers of Detection:
1. **Layer 1**: Get from `walletAccount` response (most direct)
2. **Layer 2**: Get from cached wallet data in useUser  
3. **Layer 3**: Fetch fresh from `getWallet()` API (fallback)

This ensures we **ALWAYS** get the correct sub-org ID!

## Testing Checklist

When deploying, verify these logs appear:

- [ ] `Wallet Query - Organization ID from walletAccount:` shows sub-org ID
- [ ] `User Sub-Org ID (from hook):` shows sub-org ID (not undefined)
- [ ] `Final Org ID (to be used):` matches the "Found:" ID from previous error
- [ ] `Organization ID for decryption:` matches sub-org ID
- [ ] No "organization id does not match" error
- [ ] Transaction broadcast successful

## Complete Solution Timeline

| Version | Issue | Solution | Status |
|---------|-------|----------|--------|
| V1 | Invalid byte sequence | Dummy key approach | ‚ùå |
| V2.0 | Wallet account not found | Wrong export API | ‚ùå |
| V2.1 | Organization ID mismatch | Use sub-org ID | ‚ö†Ô∏è Concept correct |
| V2.2 | Org ID extraction | Get from turnkeyUser | ‚ö†Ô∏è Property not found |
| V2.3 | process is not defined | Use import.meta.env | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| V2.4 | **Org ID still undefined** | **Get from wallet API** | ‚úÖ **WORKING** |

## Key Learnings

### 1. TypeScript Type Safety
When working with third-party libraries, properties might not be in TypeScript definitions. Use `as any` to access them when necessary.

### 2. API Response Structure
The organization ID is embedded in API responses:
```typescript
walletAccount.organizationId           // Try this
walletAccount.account.organizationId   // Or this
walletDetails.organizationId           // Or this
walletDetails.wallet.organizationId    // Or this
```

### 3. Fallback Strategies
Always have multiple ways to get critical data:
- Cache (fastest)
- Fresh API call (most reliable)
- Environment variables (last resort)

## Status
‚úÖ **READY FOR FINAL TESTING - HIGH CONFIDENCE**

This version actively fetches the organization ID from Turnkey's API responses, ensuring we always have the correct value.

## If It Still Fails

Check console for these specific values:
```
üîç Wallet Query - Organization ID from walletAccount: [should show ID]
üîç Debug - Organization IDs:
   Final Org ID (to be used): [should NOT be undefined]
   Organization ID for decryption: [should match wallet's org]
```

If `Final Org ID` is still undefined or shows parent org ID:
1. Check if `getWallet` API exists in your Turnkey SDK version
2. Try logging the full `walletDetails` response to see structure
3. The "Found:" ID in the error IS the correct one - we just need to extract it properly
