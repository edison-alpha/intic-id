Welcome to the next Stacks Builders Challenge! This is a 1-week, online innovation sprint focused on deepening Bitcoin utility through embedded wallets on Stacks. Running from October 6th to October 13th, 2025, this contest invites developers globally to build an embedded wallet integration around sBTC using Turnkey’s SDK.

We’re excited to partner with Turnkey, who will provide elevated transaction limits for participants and offer a Pro subscription to the winner, plus follow-on work for the SDK itself.

“Turnkey is proud to support the Embedded Wallet Challenge. We’re empowering builders on Stacks to deliver secure, seamless wallet experiences that improve usability and drive adoption.” -- Bryce Ferguson, CEO & Co-Founder at Turnkey

The Challenge
Build an sBTC App with Turnkey Embedded Wallet SDK
Your task: build a minimal viable product (MVP) application that integrates Turnkey’s embedded wallet SDK and enables users to transact in sBTC on Stacks.

Focus on enabling a smooth, intuitive flow within an embedded wallet experience.

The core deliverable is the integration + working sBTC transactions in your app.

The goal: show a compelling example of how embedded wallets can unlock frictionless Bitcoin-native experiences on Stacks.

Note: The winner will be eligible for a follow-up grant (e.g. $3,000 in STX) to contribute toward integrating deeper Stacks support (e.g. into Turnkey’s SDK itself) after the contest.

How It Works
The contest runs one week: Oct 6 – Oct 13, 2025

You build your submission for the embedded wallet + sBTC app track

The winner is selected based on execution, UX, robustness, and creativity

After winning, you may be offered a grant to work with Turnkey in officially adding/improving Stacks support in their SDK

Requirements
Working MVP
The app must integrate with Turnkey’s embedded wallet SDK (e.g. via @turnkey/react-wallet-kit or equivalent) (Turnkey)
The app must demonstrate sBTC transactions on Stacks
It should operate end-to-end in testnet mode
Submission Package
Public, live demo or deployed proof

GitHub repo (open-source, with documentation)

Demo video (≤ 5 minutes) showing core flows

Prize & Next Steps
$2,000 STX awarded to the winner of the embedded wallet + sBTC app

Winner becomes eligible for a follow-on $3,000 STX grant to help build or extend Turnkey’s SDK with native Stacks support

Winner will receive Turnkey Pro subscription and promotional amplifications
